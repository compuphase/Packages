<h1>Package naming standards</h1>
<div class="midsection">
<p>
There have been several attempts to come to a generic naming convention that
describes standard packages in a more precise and less ad-hoc way. The one that
has gained widest acceptance, is IPC-7351B &ldquo;<em>Naming Conventions for
Standard SMT Land Patterns</em>&rdquo;. This standard is not without its flaws,
though: internal inconsistencies and ambiguous descriptions make the standard
open to interpretation. These were set out to be fixed in the updated IPC-7351C
standard, but the work on this update stalled, the IPC workgroup disbanded and
the new workgroup has not held a meeting for the past four years.
</p>
<p>
A draft for the proposed updates for the chapter on the package naming
convention, though, was published by the author of that chapter &mdash;the
&ldquo;<em>Library Expert Footprint Naming Convention</em>&rdquo;. It is available
from <a href="https://www.pcblibraries.com/">https://www.pcblibraries.com/</a>,
requiring a free registration. Despite being an unofficial standard, this draft
document is considered the <em>current</em> IPC naming convention. For a
summary, see topic <a href="#IPC7351_summary">IPC-7351 summary</a>, and also see
the <a href="#Package_naming_examples">examples</a>.
</p>
<p>
A contender is JEITA standard ED-7303C &ldquo;<em>Name and code for integrated
circuits package</em>&rdquo; (originally an EIAJ standard; JEITA is the successor
of EIAJ). ED-7303 is more limited than IPC-7351, because it only deals with
packages for integrated circuits. The advantage, however, is that the naming
convention stays closer to the industry-standard names like TSSOP and LQFP.
Codes for pitch, span, or body sizes are affixed at the end as needed. See
topic <a href="#ED7303_summary">ED-7303 summary</a> for an overview,and also see
the <a href="#Package_naming_examples">examples</a>.
</p>
<p>
Of mention is furthermore the JEDEC standard JESD30 &ldquo;<em>Descriptive
Designation System for Electronic-device Packages</em>&rdquo;. This is an
elaborate standard that tries to describe every feature of a package. The
resulting package names are cryptic, though, and it does not appear that this
standard is active use. Curious, in this respect, is that JEDEC also maintains
a large collection of design drawings for electronic packages, categorized as a
two-letter prefix plus a sequence number (plus an optional suffix), where the
prefix is &ldquo;DO&rdquo; for diodes, &ldquo;TO&rdquo; for transistors, and
&ldquo;MO&rdquo; or &ldquo;MS&rdquo; for integrated circuits. These drawings
&ldquo;reference labels&rdquo; are actually in common use (e.g. DO-219AA as
an alias for SOD123, or TO-252 as an alias for DPAK). Yet, JESD30 ignores these
reference drawings and restarts from scratch.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, none of the above standards covers manufacturer-specific packages (and
footprints), such as those for connectors, submodules and special components. As
a result, there are no standard names for these packages either. The common
convention is that these packages are named:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <em>Manufacturer Name</em> + &ldquo;_&rdquo; + <em>Product Number</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
An example of the above convention is CUI_PJ-001AH-67. &mdash;a SMT mounted DC
power connector manufactured by CUI.
</p>
<p>
The product number may contain wild-card characters (typically an &ldquo;x&rdquo;),
in case there is a range of components that all use the same package.
</p>
</div>

<a name="Metric_versus_Imperial"></a>
<h2>Metric versus Imperial</h2>
<div class="midsection">
<p>
In the 1980s, the various standardization organizations for the electronics
industry came to an agreement to move to metric and specify the dimensions in
all future standards in millimetres. However, when the (USA-based) EIA published
the PDP-100 standard on the &ldquo;chip&rdquo; packages (for surface mount
resistors, capacitors, ferrite beads and other 2-pin parts) in 1987, the
backlash from the USA industry was such that the EIA back-pedalled on its
decision and republished the standard a year later with dimensions in both
imperial and metric.
</p>
<p>
The trouble is: the EIA also chose to identify the packages by their size. For
example, the 0805 package is a chip with a length of 8/100<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;inch
and a width of 5/100<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;inch. In other words, the package&rsquo;s
<em>label</em> is simply its dimensions in the 2D plane in increments of
0.01&nbsp;inch. In metric, this size is roughly 2.0&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;1.25&nbsp;mm.
That same 0805 package can also be labelled 2012 &mdash;again the length and
width of the package, but now in increments of 0.1&nbsp;mm. Both 0805 and 2012
refer to the same package; both are valid, standardized names for one and the
same package; both are in active use, although imperial is more common
than metric (especially in the USA).
</p>
<p>
A complication is that you cannot tell from looking at the package name alone,
whether it should be interpreted as imperial or metric. At this time, there does
not exist a package with the imperial size of 2012, so in this case you can make
an educated guess that 2012 must be interpreted as metric. However, conflicts do
exist: 0603, 0402 and 0201 are valid imperial sizes for a package as well as a
valid metric sizes &mdash;but the metric packages being more than twice as small
as their imperial counterparts with the same moniker.

Common &ldquo;chip package&rdquo; sizes, in imperial and metric
</div>
<p>
There was some hope, roughly twenty years ago, that the schism between metric
and imperial would be resolved, because the EIA suspended its yearly updates to
the PDP-100 standard in 1995, due to it being &ldquo;in revision&rdquo;. It
never materialized, though (and neither were the updates resumed). The EIA
ceased its operations in 2011.
</p>
<p>
A convention that is increasingly applied (but not yet universal) is to add an
&ldquo;M&rdquo; suffix to the metric specifications of the packages. Thus, we
speak of 0805 and 2012M.
</p>
</div>

<a name="IPC7351_summary"></a>
<h2>IPC-7351 summary</h2>
<div class="midsection">
<p>
IPC-7351 touts itself as a standard for &ldquo;land patterns&rdquo; (footprints),
and it adds a suffix at the end of every footprint name to indicate the desired
<em>density</em> of the assembly. A high density imposes a smaller footprint,
and thus IPC-7351 identifies each package with three different labels for
three standardized densities: <em>Nominal</em>, <em>Least</em> and <em>Most</em>
&mdash;where &ldquo;least&rdquo; is for the footprint with the least spacing and
the smallest pads, so for the <em>highest</em> density. In its label, the last
letter (&ldquo;N&rdquo;, &ldquo;L&rdquo; or &ldquo;M&rdquo;) indicates the
density. The density is not relevant for a package description, therefore this
letter may be dropped on the package name or variant name.
</p>
<p>
Dimensions are in 1/100<sup>th</sup> of a millimetre. The X, Y and Z dimensions
are separated with an &ldquo;X&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;X&rdquo; and &ldquo;Y&rdquo;
dimensions refer to the lead-to-lead size. For the X and Y dimensions, the value
is the nominal size; for the X dimension, the value is the maximum size. For
example, a 20-pin TSSOP package (with standard 0.65&nbsp;mm pitch) is named as
SOP20P65_650X640X110. You can dissect this name as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>package style = small outline with pins (&ldquo;SOP&rdquo;)
<li>20 pins, pitch = 0.65&nbsp;mm (65/100&nbsp;mm)
<li>lead-to-lead size = 6.5&times;6.4&nbsp;mm, max. height = 1.1&nbsp;mm
</ul>
<p>
However, for packages for discrete components, IPC-7351 switches to the (metric)
convention of PDP-100, which is 1/10th of a millimetre, and drops the
&ldquo;X&rdquo; between the X and Y dimensions. For example, a common
&ldquo;chip&rdquo; style resistor is RESC2012X50N, which we can dissect as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>component type = resistor (&ldquo;RES&rdquo;)
<li>package style = chip (&ldquo;C&rdquo;)
<li>lead-to-lead size (same as the body size) = 2.0&times1.2&nbsp;mm, max. height = 0.5&nbsp;mm
</ul>
<p>
The inclusion of the component type in the package name leads to a proliferation
of package/footprint specifications that all are essentially identical &mdash;the
type of a component is neither relevant for the package, nor for the footprint.
</p>
</div>

<a name="ED7303_summary"></a>
<h2>ED-7303 summary</h2>
<div class="midsection">
<p>
ED-7303 limits itself to packages for integrated circuits. For discrete
semiconductors, JEITA suggests using the &ldquo;SC&rdquo; codes (separate JEITA
standards). No guideline is given for discrete passive components, but EIA
PDP-100 is the obvious choice. However, that still does not solve the issue of
metric versus imperial.
</p>
<p>
The recent ED-7303 standard specifies the package sizes in millimetres. These
are plain millimetres, not scaled millimetres like in IPC-7351. Also in contrast
to IPC-7351 is that ED-7303 specifies the dimensions of the <em>body</em> of the
package, rather than the lead-to-lead size. However, ED-7303 comes of age: the
original specification is from June 1998, and it carries that history in the form
of legacy notations that are now redundant and no longer recommended &mdash;yet
still valid. This manual restricts itself to summarizing the recommended
standard.
</p>
<p>
The height of the package is encoded in a prefix to the general package name.
For example, VQFP is a QFP with a height between 0.8&nbsp;mm and 1.0&nbsp;mm;
see the table below.
</p>
<div align="center">
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Code</th><th>Description</th><th>Seated height</th></tr>
<tr><td>L</td><td>Low profile</td><td>1.2 mm  &lt;  L &le; 1.7 mm</td></tr>
<tr><td>T</td><td>Thin</td><td>1.0 mm  &lt;  T &le; 1.2 mm</td></tr>
<tr><td>V</td><td>Very thin</td><td>0.8 mm  &lt;  V &le; 1.0 mm</td></tr>
<tr><td>W</td><td>Very very thin</td><td>0.65 mm &lt;  W &le; 0.8 mm</td></tr>
<tr><td>U</td><td>Ultra thin</td><td>0.5 mm  &lt;  U &le; 0.65 mm</td></tr>
<tr><td>X</td><td>Extremely thin</td><td>X &le; 0.5 mm</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>
Other prefixes flag features like the presence of an exposed-pad (&ldquo;H&rdquo;),
or bumpered corners (&ldquo;B&rdquo;). Multiple prefixes can be chained.
</p>
<p>
An example for a package code according to ED-7303 is P-HTSSOP24-7.8x4.4-0.65,
which means:
</p>
<li>plastic body (&ldquo;P-&rdquo;)
<li>exposed-pad (&ldquo;H&rdquo;)
<li>thin (&ldquo;T&rdquo;), height between 1.0&nbsp;mm and 1.2&nbsp;mm
<li>package style = shrink small outline with pins (&ldquo;SSOP&rdquo;)
<li>24 pins
<li>body size = 7.8&times;4.4&nbsp;mm
<li>pitch 0.65&nbsp;mm
<p>
The material code (&ldquo;P-&rdquo; in the above example) is required according
to the standard, but actually superfluous &mdash;so it is, in fact, often omitted.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>&#x2460; The last letter in an IPC-7351 &ldquo;land pattern&rdquo; name is a
   code for the footprint density. It is usually &ldquo;N&rdquo;, which stands
   for nominal, but may also be &ldquo;L&rdquo; (least) or &ldquo;M&rdquo; (most).
   It is not relevant for package names, and therefore has been omitted in these
   examples.
<p>&#x2461; IPC-7351 includes the component category in the name (CAP for
   capacitor, RES for resistor, etc), even though this is irrelevant for both the
   package and the footprint.
<p>&#x2462; JEITA ED-7303 standardizes only package codes for integrated circuits. For discrete
   components, the standard refers to separate JEITA standards, notably ED-7500B.
<p>&#x2463; The first letter of a package name in ED-7303 indicates the material
   for the body, like &ldquo;P&rdquo; for plastic or &ldquo;C&rdquo; for ceramic.
   The standard asserts this prefix is mandatory; it is irrelevant for the package
   dimensions, however, and is frequently omitted.
<p>&#x2464; IPC-7351 uses the lead-to-lead size of a package, whereas ED-7303 uses
   the body size. Furthermore, for these packages, IPC-7351 changes its notation
   for the size.
