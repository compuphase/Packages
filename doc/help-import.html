<h2>Importing packages</h2>
<div class="midsection">
<p>
Packages inserted (or modified) in one repository can also be exported, and
subse­quently imported into another repository. To import a package file, open the
&ldquo;File&rdquo; menu and select &ldquo;Import&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
When importing a file, conflicts may occur. Packages requires each package name
(and alias) to be unique, and each variant name must be unique too. Any conflicts
that arise must be resolved before the file can be imported (partially or fully).
</p>
<div align="center">
  <a name="Figure_search"></a>
  <img src="searchview.png" class="center" style="max-width:90%; width:800px;">
</div>
<p>
The view for resolving import conflicts has three lists. The leftmost list contains
the packages that do not conflict. Only these can be imported. Note that the button
&ldquo;Confirm imports&rdquo; only imports the packages that have a tick in the
rightmost column, so that you can do a partial import.
</p>
<p>
To the right of the &ldquo;Non-conflicting&rdquo; list, is the list with packages
that do conflict. When you resolve all conflicts for a package, the package gets
removed from the &ldquo;Conflicting&rdquo; list and inserted in the
&ldquo;Non-conflicting&rdquo; list.
</p>
<p>
On selecting an item in the &ldquo;Conflicting&rdquo; list, the section at the
right shows the names and aliases of the package, and the table below shows the
variants of the package (if any). Conflicts may appear in either.
</p>
<p>
When names/aliases conflict, these have a yellow background. You may edit these
names, so that they no longer conflict. The table for the variants has a column
labelled &ldquo;conflict&rdquo; near the right with tick-marks for those variants
that conflict. Note that the table lists both conflicting and non-conflicting
variants. As stated above, when all variants are adjusted to be non-conflicting
and non of the names/aliases are conflicting, the package is moved to the
&ldquo;Non-conflicting&rdquo; column.
</p>
<p>
There is a final option for variants of a package with conflicting names: the
variants may be merged to the existing package in the repository. For this function,
select the variants by placing a tick in the rightmost column, and click on the
button &ldquo;Merge selected variants&rdquo;. Only those variants will then be
imported, and they will be stored as variants of the existing package.
</p>
<p>
Note that you can only place a tick-mark on variants that do not conflict. If a
variant conflicts, you must rename it before merging.
