<span class="smallcaps">Packages</span> is a tool to maintain a repository of
packages of electronic components. It is developed with the goal that various
applications use one and the same repository as a basis for their handling of
packages. The repository is in a well-documented JSON format, easy to parse in
a variety of programming languages.

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
Many packages for electronic components exist, but it is not as straightforward
as having a long list. On occasion a package name refers to a <em>group</em> of
packages, and package name on its own is not conclusive about <em>all</em>
dimensions of the package. Essentially the same package may also be known under
multiple names &mdash;this is in part the result of various standardization
bodies that each on their own standardize packages, without regard to the other
organizations doing the same.
</p>
<p>
EDA suites (Electronic Design Application) focus on a flattened view of the
package: the footprint. For mechanical design, the height of the package is
important too, and pick-&-place machines often need to know the shape of the
terminals (for example, gull-wing versus lug-lead) to recognize and centre the
component on the nozzle. That is to say: these various applications all use
package data, but they don&rsquo;t all need the <em>same</em> data.
<span class="smallcaps">Packages</span> groups the data in a structured way,
and makes it easily searchable (using both keyword search and parametric search).
</p>
<p>
This manual starts with instructions on how to use and navigate the
user-interface of the program. It then follows up with a chapter on the subject
itself: the packages for electronic components. To use
<span class="smallcaps">Packages</span> well, both chapters are equally
important, and you will find these two chapter to cross-reference each other.
</p>
<p>
The remaining chapters are reference material.

<a name="Quick_start"></a>
<h1>Quick start</h1>
<p>
On start-up, <span class="smallcaps">Packages</span> opens the repository that
was most recently used. In practice, you will probably use a single repository
for all your packages, but you can have several repositories and select the one
to browse/edit in the &ldquo;File&rdquo; menu.
</p>
<p>
Changes or additions to the repository are saved automatically on switching to
a new package or when closing the application. There still is a &ldquo;Save&rdquo;
option in the File menu, if you wish to save your edits without changing to a
different package.
</p>
<p>
The application shows a single package at a time. On the top row, you will find
the navigation buttons (browse buttons), as well as menu and search buttons.
Below that, the package information is split in three sections.
</p>
<div align="center">
  <a name="Figure_user_interface"></a>
  <img src="mainview.png" class="center" style="max-width:90%; width:800px;">
  Figure 1: user-interface, main view
</div>
<p>
The first section gives the generic package information: its name (or
identification), its body size, number of pins, pitch between the pins,
termination style (shape of the leads), and other characteristics.
</p>
<p>
The second section lists variants of the same &ldquo;common shape&rdquo; for the
package. The variant adds the height of the package, the standard it conforms
to (if any) and the presence of an exposed pad (or &ldquo;thermal pad&rdquo;) to the
generic information. See topic <a href="#Common_names_variants">Common names &amp; variants</a>
for the distinction between a generic package and a variant.
</p>
<p>
The third section gives detailed information about the footprint for the
package: the shape and size of the pads, and the positions of these pads. As an
aside, <span class="smallcaps">Packages</span> does not generate footprints for
any EDA program &mdash;that is not its goal. However, due to the open format of
the output file, a third-party script can use the detailed information on the
package and pads to generate these footprints.
</p>
<p>
On start-up, <span class="smallcaps">Packages</span> shows the full list with
all packages in the repository. You can restrict the range to a subset, based
on keywords or specific package parameters (e.g. span, height, pin count). See
topic <a href="#Searching_and_filtering_packages">Searching and filtering packages</a>
for details.
</p>

<a name="Adding_modifying_and_deleting_packages"></a>
<h2>Adding, modifying and deleting packages</h2>
<p>
Depending on the package, not all data may be relevant. However, the top section
(of the user-interface, see <a href="#Figure_user_interface">Figure 1</a>) should
always be completed.
</p>

<h3>Names, description</h3>
<p>
A package may have more than one name &mdash;this is covered in detail in the topic
<a href="#Common_names_variants">Common names &amp; variants</a>. The names that
refer to the generic &ldquo;flat view&rdquo; shape of the package, should be listed as
names in the top section. Other applications can use these aliases to look up
package information in the course of exchanging data: different programs used in
electronics production may use different names for the same package. Applications
can also use the aliases to translate all packages being entered into the system
to a preferred naming convention.
</p>
In the case of &ldquo;chip&rdquo; packages, like 0603 and 0805, we recommend to
include both the &ldquo;imperial&rdquo; name and the &ldquo;metric&rdquo; name
for the package (in this case 1508 and 2012 respectively). As explained in
<a href="#Metric_versus_Imperial">Metric versus Imperial</a>, conflicts arise for
the smaller packages: for example, 0603 is a valid package label in both imperial
and metric &mdash;but pointing to two very different packages. Since
<span class="smallcaps">Packages</span> does not allow for naming conflicts, our
recommendation is to add an &ldquo;M&rdquo; suffix to the metric label: the
equivalent for 0603 is 1508M, and 0805 is 2012M.
<p>
In general, we also suggest to put the preferred name(s) first in the list of
names. When an application translates package names into a preferred naming
convention, it typically picks the first &ldquo;preferred name&rdquo; that matches
the chosen naming convention.
</p>
<p>
The description is optional, and contains general purpose text. The description
is included in the search function, so you can use the description to include
search terms that are not covered by the other fields.
</p>

<h3>Characteristics</h3>
<p>
For SMD type packages (the focus of the <span class="smallcaps">Packages</span>
application and data file), the termination field is an important parameter.
For optical alignment, pick-&amp;-place machines need to know at what elevation
to scan the (body of the) component, and that depends on the lead shape.
Therefore, packages that are identical apart from their termination style, must
be entered as separate packages. For example, SOD123 and SOD123F have gull-wing
and lug-lead terminations respectively, and they are therefore separate
packages &mdash;not variants.
</p>
<p>
The fields for the pin count and pitch are fairly self-explanatory (see also
topic <a href="#Pitch_and_spans">Pitch and spans</a> for the pitch dimension).
An exposed-pad (or thermal pad) is seen as an attribute of a package, and it is
typically not included in the pin count.
</p>
<p>
The tape packaging orientation is standardized for common parts (see chapter
<a href="#Normal_orientations">Normal orientations</a>). For connectors or
exotic packages, the tape orientation can be selected here. Tape packaging
orientation is relevant only for components package is tape (on reel); for
packages too big for tape packaging, leave this field at zero. Again, see
chapter <a href="#Normal_orientations">Normal orientations</a> for details.
</p>
<p>
The relevance of the &ldquo;polarized&rdquo; field is that packages for polarized
components are regularly oriented differently in tape packaging than those for
non-polarized parts.
</p>

<h3>Body size, lead-to-lead size</h3>
<p>
Body size and lead-to-lead size are also inherent characteristics of a package.
These sizes allow for a tolerance, however (this tolerance can be looked up in
the specifications of the respective packages). See topic
<a href="#Package_dimensions_and_outlines">Package dimensions and outlines</a>
for details on the various &ldquo;size&rdquo; specifications of a package.
</p>
<p>
If a package does not have pins (termination is either &ldquo;endcap&rdquo; or
&ldquo;no-lead&rdquo;, the lead-to-lead size does not need to be filled in (it is
by consequence identical to the body size).
</p>

<h3>Variants</h3>
<p>
The middle section in the user interface (see <a href="#Figure_user_interface">Figure 1</a>)
is for the variants of the generic package. The generic package portrays a
flattened view. For a long time, EDA programs needed no more that this
representation. For assembly of the PCB, and for mechanical design (e.g. design
of the enclosure), the height of the package also becomes an important parameter
(and it is quite common that a generic package exists in different heights).
This is why the details of various variants can be entered in a table. See the
topic <a href="#Common_names_variants">Common names &amp; variants</a> for
background information.
</p>
<p>
For example, an LQFP package and an TQFP package share all parameters (and they
share it with the generic QFP package), except that LQFP is about 1.5&thinsp;mm thick
and TQFP about 1.0&thinsp;mm.
</p>
<p>
Each variant must have a unique name, and the name of a variant may not conflict
with any of the aliases for the generic package either. Names for variants may
follow a standard or an ad-hoc convention &mdash;see also topic
<a href="#Package_naming_standards">Package naming standards</a>. If it is a
standardized convention, you can indicate that convention on the row too. Doing
so enables applications to translate between naming conventions.
</p>
<p>
For the &ldquo;flat view&rdquo; dimensions, <span class="smallcaps">Packages</span>
stores the <em>nominal</em> size and a tolerance from that nominal size. For the height,
it uses a range: minimum height to maximum height. The motivation is that package
standards also specify the height as a range; IPC-7351 only records a <em>maximum</em>
height in its naming convention.
</p>

<h3>Footprint</h3>
<p>
The bottom section of the user interface (<a href="#Figure_user_interface">Figure 1</a>)
has design parameters for the footprint.
</p>
<p>
The majority of footprints use a single pad shape & size for most (or all) of
the pins. <span class="smallcaps">Packages</span> splits the pad shapes from the
pad positions for a package. Thus, you often need to add only one or two pad
shapes, even for packages with a high pin count.
</p>
<p>
In the pad shape specification, you can furthermore mark a pad as &ldquo;exposed
pad&rdquo; (also called a thermal pad). A pad marked as such is then only valid
for those variants that are also marked as having an exposed pad (in the
&ldquo;variants&rdquo; section of <a href="#Figure_user_interface">Figure 1</a>).
</p>
<p>
For example, for a HSOIC8 package (8-pin SOIC with 1.27&thinsp;mm pitch and an exposed-pad):
</p>
<ul>
<li> a variant for the package must be added, with an appropriate name (for
     example, SOIC8P127_495X600X175T330X240 according to IPC-7351, or
     HSOIC8-3.8x4.95 according to ED-7303);
<li> in the column &ldquo;exposed-pad&rdquo;, a tick mark should be placed on
     the row for the variant;
<li> in the footprint section, a pad shape must be added with the size of the
     exposed-pad, and this pad must also have a tick mark in the column
     &ldquo;exposed-pad&rdquo; (this will have pad-id 2 for this example package);
<li> a pad with pin-id 9 (one more than the pin count of the package, so 9 for
     an SOIC8) must be added, and referencing pad-id 2.
</ul>
<p>
The exposed pad is typically <em>not</em> included in the pin count (in the package
characteristics, top section of <a href="#Figure_user_interface">Figure 1</a>).
</p>

<a name="Searching_and_filtering_packages"></a>
<h2>Searching and filtering packages</h2>
<p>
You can open the search view by clicking the button &ldquo;Search&rdquo; (top right
in <a href="#Figure_user_interface">Figure 1</a>) or with the key combination
Ctrl+F.
</p>
<div align="center">
  <a name="Figure_search"></a>
  <img src="searchview.png" class="center" style="max-width:90%; width:800px;">
</div>
<p>
The search is on keywords and/or specific package parameters. Only exact matches
are found for the pin count and the pitch, if these are set as search parameters.
However, for the span, a 10% margin applies.
</p>
<p>
Next to jumping to a match (by double-clicking on the row in the &ldquo;matches&rdquo;
table), you can add one or more matches to a selection. When a selection is
active, the range of packages in the main view (<a href="#Figure_user_interface">Figure 1</a>)
is restricted to the selection. Multiple disjoint searches can be added to a
selection.
</p>

<a name="Package_concepts"></a>
<h1>Package concepts</h1>
<p>
It is obvious that a specification for a component package needs to record the
size, number of pins, pitch, and a few other characteristics. And it needs to
have a kind of label that uniquely identifies it. Yet, as you look at the
user-interface of Packages, you will spot right-away that there are
multiple, different, fields for the size of the package, as well as multiple
&ldquo;labels&rdquo; that all uniquely point to the same package.
</p>

<a name="Common_names_variants"></a>
<h2>Common names &amp; variants</h2>
<p>
The QFP group of packages comprises ranges of with pin counts from 16 to 256 and
pitches from 0.4&nbsp;mm to 1.0&nbsp;mm. With a chosen pin count and pitch, for example
QFP32 with pith 0.5, the name still refers to a group of packages that all share
the essential dimensions in the flat plane. There are variants, like LQFP which
is about 1.5&nbsp;mm thick as opposed to 2.8&nbsp;mm nominally for the plain QFP
(the &ldquo;L&rdquo; in LQFP stands for <em>low-profile</em>), or TQFP with a
nominal height of 1.0&nbsp;mm (&ldquo;T&rdquo; stands for <em>thin</em>). There
are also variants with <em>bumpers</em> in the corners to protect the leads, but
these bumpers are not included in the body size &mdash;so the core dimensions
are still the same as for QFP.
</p>
<p>
All these variants (with the same pin count & pitch) share the same footprint,
and have the same pitch and body &amp; lead-to-lead sizes.
<span class="smallcaps">Packages</span> therefore groups them together in a
single specification. The variants, are listed in that specification with their
distinguishing attributes.
</p>
<p>
Regardless, even a package <em>group</em> may be known under different names. As
already noted earlier, in part this is due to different standardization organizations
writing their own standard for one and the same package; see chapter
<a href="#Package_naming_standards">Package naming standards</a> for more
information. Also note that standardization organizations tend to follow
industry practice &mdash;the package exists before the standard gets written.
Therefore, <span class="smallcaps">Packages</span> allows you to add aliases for
each common name (as well as adding variants).
</p>
<p>
See also the topic <a href="#Metric_versus_Imperial">Metric versus Imperial</a>
for another reason why a class is known under different names: sometimes a
standardization organization cannot decide what is (or should be) the <em>standard</em>.
</p>

<a name="Package_dimensions_and_outlines"></a>
<h2>Package dimensions and outlines</h2>
<p>
The size or <em>bounding box</em> of a package may refer to one of <em>four</em>
dimensions, and each has its purpose.
</p>
<div align="center">
  <a name="Figure_courtyard"></a>
  <img src="courtyard.png" class="center" style="max-width:80%; width:720px;">
  Figure 2: Package sizes
</div>
<p>
The <em>body size</em> is, indeed, the size of the bounding box around the body
excluding the pins. The <em>lead-to-lead size</em> is the bounding box <em>including</em>
the pins. For packages that have no pins extruding from the sides of body (like
QFN or BGA), the body and lead-to-lead sizes are the same. In the package data
file (see chapter <a href="#File_format_specification">File format specification</a>),
the lead-to-lead size may be omitted in case it is equal to the body size.
</p>
<p>
The <em>footprint contour</em> (also called the footprint <em>outline</em>) is
the bounding box around the footprint. With the SOT23-5 example in the picture
above, the contour is wider than the lead-to-lead size, but not as high. The
<em>courtyard</em> goes around the package, the leads and the footprint; this is
always the biggest size.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Packages</span> stores the body size, lead-to-lead size
and footprint contour. The courtyard is not stored, because it is the envelope
around the lead-to-lead size and the footprint contour (and it can therefore be
derived from these dimensions).
</p>
<p>
The horizontal and vertical dimensions for body, lead-to-lead, spans and others
depend on how the how the package is oriented: turn it by 90 degrees and the
x&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;y swap places. Therefore, to properly specify the any dimensions of a
package, we must first establish the <em>normal orientation</em> (or zero-orientation)
of that package. See chapter <a href="#Normal_orientations">Normal orientations</a>
for the standardized normal orientations of packages.
</p>

<a name="Origin_offsets"></a>
<h2>Origin offsets</h2>
<p>
An essential concept for machine assembly of a PCB (with a pick-&-place machine)
is the centroid: the centre of mass. A pick-&-place machine picks up the component
at its centroid. The rationale is that pick-&-place machines use suction to hold
the component &ldquo;glued&rdquo; to its nozzle, and the amount of suction is
calibrated to the weight of the component. However, if a component is not in
balance beneath the nozzle, it may &ldquo;float&rdquo; on the nozzle as the
nozzle accelerates and decelerates in its movements from the feeder to the
placement position. In other words, placement may then be less accurate.
</p>
<p>
For symmetric packages (the grand majority of packages), the centroid coincides
with the geometric centre. For these, the origin offsets are zero, for the body,
the lead-to-lead envelope and for the footprint contour. Otherwise, you need to
specify the appropriate offsets of the geometric centre relative to the centroid.
</p>
<div align="center">
  <a name="Figure_centroidoffset"></a>
  <img src="centroidoffset.png" class="center" style="max-width:80%; width:640px;">
  Figure 3: Centroid and geometric offset
</div>
<p>
In the above figure of a TO-252 package (also known as DPAK), the centroid is
marked with the blue &#x2295; symbol. When looking at the body of the TO-252 package,
the centroid still falls on the geometric centre of the body &mdash;which is by
design. For the lead-to-lead envelope, this is not the case: the geometric
centre is offset to the left of the centroid. In the concrete case of the
TO-252 package, the origin offset of the lead-to-lead envelope is
X:&nbsp;-0.9&nbsp;mm, Y:&nbsp;0&nbsp;mm.
</p>
<p>
The figure omits a drawing of the footprint for this package, but an origin
offset applies to the footprint contour as well (and, consequently, to the
courtyard too).
</p>

<a name="Pitch_and_spans"></a>
<h2>Pitch and spans</h2>
<p>
The pitch is the distance between two pins or pads on the same row. The span is
the distance between pads of opposing rows. It is illustrated in <a href="#Figure_pitch_span">Figure 4</a>
with a footprint for the SOT23-5 package.
<p>
<div align="center">
  <a name="Figure_pitch_span"></a>
  <img src="footprint-pitch-span.png" class="center" style="max-width:80%; width:226px;">
  Figure 4: Pitch and span (on a footprint)
</div>
</p>
The pitch is an attribute of the package (the pitch of a footprint is
necessarily the same as the spacing of the pins of the package), but the span
depends on the footprint. Typically, the span (horizontal and/or vertical) is
slightly smaller than the lead-to-lead size in the same direction, but there is
no hard rule &mdash;it depends on the termination type amongst others. A quad-row
package has both a horizontal and a vertical span; these are the same for square
packages, but different for a quad-row rectangular package.
<p>
</p>
A 2-pin surface-mount component typically has a span, but not a pitch.
Through-hole 2-pin connectors form an exception, their pin distance is often
specified as their &ldquo;pin pitch&rdquo;.
<p>

<a name="File_format"></a>
<h1>File format</h1>
<p>
The package file is a JSON file with an array of &ldquo;objects&rdquo;, each object
representing a package. The table below describes the fields for a single
package.
</p>
<p>
Fields that are not relevant for a particular package may be omitted. For
example, the &ldquo;exposed-pad&rdquo; field is irrelevant for a 2-pin
&ldquo;chip&rdquo; package, and it is usually not recorded. Likewise, for packages
with &ldquo;endcap&rdquo; or &ldquo;no-lead&rdquo; terminations, the lead-to-lead
size is identical to the body size, and it is then sufficient to record the body
size.
</p>
<p>
For fields that have an array type, if that array has no elements, the field
may also be set to null. For example, when a package has no variants, the
variants field may be set to null, rather than an empty array. Still, the
preferred way to handle this case is to not include the variants field at all.

For the pad shape, a square pad is stored as a &ldquo;rectangle&rdquo; shape;
the cx and cy parameters will establish that it is square. The radius for the
rounded corners of a &ldquo;roundedrect&rdquo; shape is not specified; in the
scope of  <span class="smallcaps">Packages</span>, the intent is to flag the pad
shape as an intermediate form  between rectangle and obround.

All coordinates assume that in the 2D projection, the Y-axis points upwards.
This is in conformance with the Gerber standard. Some design programs use a
downward Y-axis &mdash;a common convention in the early days of computing. Such
programs should flip the sign on Y coordinates on reading the data from the
JSON file.

<h1>Normal orientations</h1>
<p>
The normal orientation is the orientation that the component has when its
rotation is zero degrees. There are two predominant standards for the normal
orientation of components on a PCB. Fortunately, these two standards, IPC-7351
and IEC&nbsp;61188-7 &ldquo;Level A&rdquo;, are compatible with each other.
</p>
<p>
In brief, the normal orientation of 2-pin packages is such that pin 1 is on the
left and pin 2 is on the right. For polarized components, such as electrolytic
or tantalum capacitors, pin 1 is the &ldquo;plus&rdquo;-pin. For diodes, pin 1 is
the cathode. For packages with more than 2 pins, the component is oriented as
such that pin 1 is aligned to the top left corner. If pin 1 is in the middle of
an edge, instead of near a corner, pin 1 must be aligned to the top. A few
exceptions to these general rules are noted beneath the table.
</p>
<p>
Most surface mount components come packaged in tape, on reel. A separate
standard exists for how the components are packaged in carrier tape, EIA-481.
Manufacturers generally adhere to the EIA-481 standard, but many also specify
exceptions for specific component packages; for example, many manufactures have
continued to package QFP and QFN packages according to the rules in EIA-481<b>C</b>
instead of adopting the changes of EIA-481<b>D</b>.
</p>
<p>
The table below shows the normal orientations according to IPC-7351 and the
packaging orientation according to the latest EIA-481 standard. The angle by
which a package must be rotated to go from EIA-481 to IPC-7351 is also given.
</p>
<p>
Note that EIA-481 only applies to packaging in tape; see the notes at the end of
this section for tube and tray packaging.

<h2>Notes</h2>

<h3>PLCC2, PLCC4 and PLCC6</h3>
<p>
The low pin count PLCC packages for LEDs have a chamfered corner to mark pin&nbsp;1.
For PLCC2, pin one is usually the cathode (conforming to IPC-7351); for RGB
LEDs in PLCC4 and PLCC6 packages, pin 1 is typically the common anode.
</p>
<p>
The PLCC4 package uses a clockwise pin numbering scheme, starting from pin&nbsp;1
in the upper left corner. The zero-orientation is not explicitly defined in the
IPC-7351 standard (because IPC-7351 assumes a counter-clockwise pin numbering).
</p>
<p>
The PLCC6 package uses a counter-clockwise pin numbering scheme, similar to
dual-line IC packages.
</p>

<h3>Crystals, ceramic resonators, oscillators</h3>
<p>
Crystals in a 2-pin chip package follow the orientation of 2-pin non-polarized
chip packages. Ceramic resonators with three aligned pins are oriented as shown
in the table.
</p>
<p>
For crystals and crystal oscillators with four pins (or more), the orientation
in tape is inconclusive. Rectangular shaped crystals generally follow the
alignment as shown in the table. Square packages (which are typically
oscillators, rather than crystals) regularly use the orientation of PLCC4.
</p>
<p>
4-pin crystals and oscillators may use a clockwise pin numbering, like PLCC4.
For crystals, the pin numbering direction is mostly irrelevant, because the
crystal is typically connected between pins 1 and 3 (with pins 2 and 4 either
unconnected, or both connected to ground). Regardless of the direction of the
pin numbering, pins 1&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;3 are at the same positions.
</p>

<h3>Tube and tray orientations</h3>
<p>
Components are oriented sideways in tube (sticks), such that the pins of
consecutive components do not touch. The end of the tube that &ldquo;pin&nbsp;1&rdquo;
of the component points to is often marked with a green stop or pin.
</p>
<p>
JEDEC trays have a chamfered corner. If the tray is oriented such that the
chamfered corner is on the upper left, the components in the tray are oriented
according to IPC-7351.
</p>

<a name="Package_naming_standards"></a>
<h1>Package naming standards</h1>
<p>
There have been several attempts to come to a generic naming convention that
describes standard packages in a more precise and less ad-hoc way. The one that
has gained widest acceptance, is IPC-7351B &ldquo;<em>Naming Conventions for
Standard SMT Land Patterns</em>&rdquo;. This standard is not without its flaws,
though: internal inconsistencies and ambiguous descriptions make the standard
open to interpretation. These were set out to be fixed in the updated IPC-7351C
standard, but the work on this update stalled, the IPC workgroup disbanded and
the new workgroup has not held a meeting for the past four years.
</p>
<p>
A draft for the proposed updates for the chapter on the package naming
convention, though, was published by the author of that chapter &mdash;the
&ldquo;<em>Library Expert Footprint Naming Convention</em>&rdquo;. It is available
from <a href="https://www.pcblibraries.com/">https://www.pcblibraries.com/</a>,
requiring a free registration. Despite being an unofficial standard, this draft
document is considered the <em>current</em> IPC naming convention. For a
summary, see topic <a href="#IPC7351_summary">IPC-7351 summary</a>, and also see
the <a href="#Package_naming_examples">examples</a>.
</p>
<p>
A contender is JEITA standard ED-7303C &ldquo;<em>Name and code for integrated
circuits package</em>&rdquo; (originally an EIAJ standard; JEITA is the successor
of EIAJ). ED-7303 is more limited than IPC-7351, because it only deals with
packages for integrated circuits. The advantage, however, is that the naming
convention stays closer to the industry-standard names like TSSOP and LQFP.
Codes for pitch, span, or body sizes are affixed at the end as needed. See
topic <a href="#ED7303_summary">ED-7303 summary</a> for an overview,and also see
the <a href="#Package_naming_examples">examples</a>.
</p>
<p>
Of mention is furthermore the JEDEC standard JESD30 &ldquo;<em>Descriptive
Designation System for Electronic-device Packages</em>&rdquo;. This is an
elaborate standard that tries to describe every feature of a package. The
resulting package names are cryptic, though, and it does not appear that this
standard is active use. Curious, in this respect, is that JEDEC also maintains
a large collection of design drawings for electronic packages, categorized as a
two-letter prefix plus a sequence number (plus an optional suffix), where the
prefix is &ldquo;DO&rdquo; for diodes, &ldquo;TO&rdquo; for transistors, and
&ldquo;MO&rdquo; or &ldquo;MS&rdquo; for integrated circuits. These drawings
&ldquo;reference labels&rdquo; are actually in common use (e.g. DO-219AA as
an alias for SOD123, or TO-252 as an alias for DPAK). Yet, JESD30 ignores these
reference drawings and restarts from scratch.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, none of the above standards covers manufacturer-specific packages (and
footprints), such as those for connectors, submodules and special components. As
a result, there are no standard names for these packages either. The common
convention is that these packages are named:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <em>Manufacturer Name</em> + &ldquo;_&rdquo; + <em>Product Number</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
An example of the above convention is CUI_PJ-001AH-67. &mdash;a SMT mounted DC
power connector manufactured by CUI.
</p>
<p>
The product number may contain wild-card characters (typically an &ldquo;x&rdquo;),
in case there is a range of components that all use the same package.
</p>

<a name="Metric_versus_Imperial"></a>
<h2>Metric versus Imperial</h2>
<p>
In the 1980s, the various standardization organizations for the electronics
industry came to an agreement to move to metric and specify the dimensions in
all future standards in millimetres. However, when the (USA-based) EIA published
the PDP-100 standard on the &ldquo;chip&rdquo; packages (for surface mount
resistors, capacitors, ferrite beads and other 2-pin parts) in 1987, the
backlash from the USA industry was such that the EIA back-pedalled on its
decision and republished the standard a year later with dimensions in both
imperial and metric.
</p>
<p>
The trouble is: the EIA also chose to identify the packages by their size. For
example, the 0805 package is a chip with a length of 8/100<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;inch
and a width of 5/100<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;inch. In other words, the package&rsquo;s
<em>label</em> is simply its dimensions in the 2D plane in increments of
0.01&nbsp;inch. In metric, this size is roughly 2.0&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;1.25&nbsp;mm.
That same 0805 package can also be labelled 2012 &mdash;again the length and
width of the package, but now in increments of 0.1&nbsp;mm. Both 0805 and 2012
refer to the same package; both are valid, standardized names for one and the
same package; both are in active use, although imperial is more common
than metric (especially in the USA).
</p>
<p>
A complication is that you cannot tell from looking at the package name alone,
whether it should be interpreted as imperial or metric. At this time, there does
not exist a package with the imperial size of 2012, so in this case you can make
an educated guess that 2012 must be interpreted as metric. However, conflicts do
exist: 0603, 0402 and 0201 are valid imperial sizes for a package as well as a
valid metric sizes &mdash;but the metric packages being more than twice as small
as their imperial counterparts with the same moniker.

Common &ldquo;chip package&rdquo; sizes, in imperial and metric
</div>
<p>
There was some hope, roughly twenty years ago, that the schism between metric
and imperial would be resolved, because the EIA suspended its yearly updates to
the PDP-100 standard in 1995, due to it being &ldquo;in revision&rdquo;. It
never materialized, though (and neither were the updates resumed). The EIA
ceased its operations in 2011.
</p>
<p>
A convention that is increasingly applied (but not yet universal) is to add an
&ldquo;M&rdquo; suffix to the metric specifications of the packages. Thus, we
speak of 0805 and 2012M.
</p>

<a name="IPC7351_summary"></a>
<h2>IPC-7351 summary</h2>
<p>
IPC-7351 touts itself as a standard for &ldquo;land patterns&rdquo; (footprints),
and it adds a suffix at the end of every footprint name to indicate the desired
<em>density</em> of the assembly. A high density imposes a smaller footprint,
and thus IPC-7351 identifies each package with three different labels for
three standardized densities: <em>Nominal</em>, <em>Least</em> and <em>Most</em>
&mdash;where &ldquo;least&rdquo; is for the footprint with the least spacing and
the smallest pads, so for the <em>highest</em> density. In its label, the last
letter (&ldquo;N&rdquo;, &ldquo;L&rdquo; or &ldquo;M&rdquo;) indicates the
density. The density is not relevant for a package description, therefore this
letter may be dropped on the package name or variant name.
</p>
<p>
Dimensions are in 1/100<sup>th</sup> of a millimetre. The X, Y and Z dimensions
are separated with an &ldquo;X&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;X&rdquo; and &ldquo;Y&rdquo;
dimensions refer to the lead-to-lead size. For the X and Y dimensions, the value
is the nominal size; for the X dimension, the value is the maximum size. For
example, a 20-pin TSSOP package (with standard 0.65&nbsp;mm pitch) is named as
SOP20P65_650X640X110. You can dissect this name as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>package style = small outline with pins (&ldquo;SOP&rdquo;)
<li>20 pins, pitch = 0.65&nbsp;mm (65/100&nbsp;mm)
<li>lead-to-lead size = 6.5&times;6.4&nbsp;mm, max. height = 1.1&nbsp;mm
</ul>
<p>
However, for packages for discrete components, IPC-7351 switches to the (metric)
convention of PDP-100, which is 1/10th of a millimetre, and drops the
&ldquo;X&rdquo; between the X and Y dimensions. For example, a common
&ldquo;chip&rdquo; style resistor is RESC2012X50N, which we can dissect as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>component type = resistor (&ldquo;RES&rdquo;)
<li>package style = chip (&ldquo;C&rdquo;)
<li>lead-to-lead size (same as the body size) = 2.0&times1.2&nbsp;mm, max. height = 0.5&nbsp;mm
</ul>
<p>
The inclusion of the component type in the package name leads to a proliferation
of package/footprint specifications that all are essentially identical &mdash;the
type of a component is neither relevant for the package, nor for the footprint.
</p>

<a name="ED7303_summary"></a>
<h2>ED-7303 summary</h2>
<p>
ED-7303 limits itself to packages for integrated circuits. For discrete
semiconductors, JEITA suggests using the &ldquo;SC&rdquo; codes (separate JEITA
standards). No guideline is given for discrete passive components, but EIA
PDP-100 is the obvious choice. However, that still does not solve the issue of
metric versus imperial.
</p>
<p>
The recent ED-7303 standard specifies the package sizes in millimetres. These
are plain millimetres, not scaled millimetres like in IPC-7351. Also in contrast
to IPC-7351 is that ED-7303 specifies the dimensions of the <em>body</em> of the
package, rather than the lead-to-lead size. However, ED-7303 comes of age: the
original specification is from June 1998, and it carries that history in the form
of legacy notations that are now redundant and no longer recommended &mdash;yet
still valid. This manual restricts itself to summarizing the recommended
standard.
</p>
<p>
The height of the package is encoded in a prefix to the general package name.
For example, VQFP is a QFP with a height between 0.8&nbsp;mm and 1.0&nbsp;mm;
see the table below.
</p>
<div align="center">
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Code</th><th>Description</th><th>Seated height</th></tr>
<tr><td>L</td><td>Low profile</td><td>1.2 mm  &lt;  L &le; 1.7 mm</td></tr>
<tr><td>T</td><td>Thin</td><td>1.0 mm  &lt;  T &le; 1.2 mm</td></tr>
<tr><td>V</td><td>Very thin</td><td>0.8 mm  &lt;  V &le; 1.0 mm</td></tr>
<tr><td>W</td><td>Very very thin</td><td>0.65 mm &lt;  W &le; 0.8 mm</td></tr>
<tr><td>U</td><td>Ultra thin</td><td>0.5 mm  &lt;  U &le; 0.65 mm</td></tr>
<tr><td>X</td><td>Extremely thin</td><td>X &le; 0.5 mm</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>
Other prefixes flag features like the presence of an exposed-pad (&ldquo;H&rdquo;),
or bumpered corners (&ldquo;B&rdquo;). Multiple prefixes can be chained.
</p>
<p>
An example for a package code according to ED-7303 is P-HTSSOP24-7.8x4.4-0.65,
which means:
</p>
<li>plastic body (&ldquo;P-&rdquo;)
<li>exposed-pad (&ldquo;H&rdquo;)
<li>thin (&ldquo;T&rdquo;), height between 1.0&nbsp;mm and 1.2&nbsp;mm
<li>package style = shrink small outline with pins (&ldquo;SSOP&rdquo;)
<li>24 pins
<li>body size = 7.8&times;4.4&nbsp;mm
<li>pitch 0.65&nbsp;mm
<p>
The material code (&ldquo;P-&rdquo; in the above example) is required according
to the standard, but actually superfluous &mdash;so it is, in fact, often omitted.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>&#x2460; The last letter in an IPC-7351 &ldquo;land pattern&rdquo; name is a
   code for the footprint density. It is usually &ldquo;N&rdquo;, which stands
   for nominal, but may also be &ldquo;L&rdquo; (least) or &ldquo;M&rdquo; (most).
   It is not relevant for package names, and therefore has been omitted in these
   examples.
<p>&#x2461; IPC-7351 includes the component category in the name (CAP for
   capacitor, RES for resistor, etc), even though this is irrelevant for both the
   package and the footprint.
<p>&#x2462; JEITA ED-7303 standardizes only package codes for integrated circuits. For discrete
   components, the standard refers to separate JEITA standards, notably ED-7500B.
<p>&#x2463; The first letter of a package name in ED-7303 indicates the material
   for the body, like &ldquo;P&rdquo; for plastic or &ldquo;C&rdquo; for ceramic.
   The standard asserts this prefix is mandatory; it is irrelevant for the package
   dimensions, however, and is frequently omitted.
<p>&#x2464; IPC-7351 uses the lead-to-lead size of a package, whereas ED-7303 uses
   the body size. Furthermore, for these packages, IPC-7351 changes its notation
   for the size.
