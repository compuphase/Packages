<h1>Adding, modifying and deleting packages</h1>
<div class="midsection">
<p>
The application shows a single package at a time. On the top row, you will find
the navigation buttons (browse buttons), as well as menu and search buttons.
Below that, the package information is split in three sections.
</p>
<div align="center">
  <a name="Figure_user_interface"></a>
  <img src="mainview.png" class="center" style="max-width:90%; width:800px;">
  Figure 1: user-interface, main view
</div>
<p>
The first section gives the generic package information: its name (or
identification), its body size, number of pins, pitch between the pins,
termination style (shape of the leads), and other characteristics.
</p>
<p>
The second section lists variants of the same &ldquo;common shape&rdquo; for the
package. The variant adds the height of the package, the standard it conforms
to (if any) and the presence of an exposed pad (or &ldquo;thermal pad&rdquo;) to the
generic information. See topic <a href="help-concepts.html#Common_names_variants">Common names &amp; variants</a>
for the distinction between a generic package and a variant.
</p>
<p>
The third section gives detailed information about the footprint for the
package: the shape and size of the pads, and the positions of these pads. As an
aside, <span class="smallcaps">Packages</span> does not generate footprints for
any EDA program &mdash;that is not its goal. However, due to the open format of
the output file, a third-party script can use the detailed information on the
package and pads to generate these footprints.
</p>
<p>
Depending on the package, not all data may be relevant. However, the top section
(of the user-interface, see <a href="#Figure_user_interface">Figure 1</a>) should
always be completed.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Names, description</h2>
<div class="midsection">
<p>
A package may have more than one name &mdash;this is covered in detail in the topic
<a href="help-concepts.html#Common_names_variants">Common names &amp; variants</a>. The names that
refer to the generic &ldquo;flat view&rdquo; shape of the package, should be listed as
names in the top section. Other applications can use these aliases to look up
package information in the course of exchanging data: different programs used in
electronics production may use different names for the same package. Applications
can also use the aliases to translate all packages being entered into the system
to a preferred naming convention.
</p>
In the case of &ldquo;chip&rdquo; packages, like 0603 and 0805, we recommend to
include both the &ldquo;imperial&rdquo; name and the &ldquo;metric&rdquo; name
for the package (in this case 1508 and 2012 respectively). As explained in
<a href="help-standards.html#Metric_versus_Imperial">Metric versus Imperial</a>, conflicts arise for
the smaller packages: for example, 0603 is a valid package label in both imperial
and metric &mdash;but pointing to two very different packages. Since
<span class="smallcaps">Packages</span> does not allow for naming conflicts, our
recommendation is to add an &ldquo;M&rdquo; suffix to the metric label: the
equivalent for 0603 is 1508M, and 0805 is 2012M.
<p>
In general, we also suggest to put the preferred name(s) first in the list of
names. When an application translates package names into a preferred naming
convention, it typically picks the first &ldquo;preferred name&rdquo; that matches
the chosen naming convention.
</p>
<p>
The description is optional, and contains general purpose text. The description
is included in the search function, so you can use the description to include
search terms that are not covered by the other fields.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Characteristics</h2>
<div class="midsection">
<p>
For SMD type packages (the focus of the <span class="smallcaps">Packages</span>
application and data file), the termination field is an important parameter.
For optical alignment, pick-&amp;-place machines need to know at what elevation
to scan the (body of the) component, and that depends on the lead shape.
Therefore, packages that are identical apart from their termination style, must
be entered as separate packages. For example, SOD123 and SOD123F have gull-wing
and lug-lead terminations respectively, and they are therefore separate
packages &mdash;not variants.
</p>
<p>
The fields for the pin count and pitch are fairly self-explanatory (see also
topic <a href="help-concepts.html#Pitch_and_spans">Pitch and spans</a> for the pitch dimension).
An exposed-pad (or thermal pad) is seen as an attribute of a package, and it is
typically not included in the pin count.
</p>
<p>
The tape packaging orientation is standardized for common parts (see chapter
<a href="help-packages.html#Normal_orientations">Normal orientations</a>). For connectors or
exotic packages, the tape orientation can be selected here. Tape packaging
orientation is relevant only for components package is tape (on reel); for
packages too big for tape packaging, leave this field at zero. Again, see
chapter <a href="help-packages.html#Normal_orientations">Normal orientations</a> for details.
</p>
<p>
The relevance of the &ldquo;polarized&rdquo; field is that packages for polarized
components are regularly oriented differently in tape packaging than those for
non-polarized parts.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Body size, lead-to-lead size</h2>
<div class="midsection">
<p>
Body size and lead-to-lead size are also inherent characteristics of a package.
These sizes allow for a tolerance, however (this tolerance can be looked up in
the specifications of the respective packages). See topic
<a href="help-concepts.html#Package_dimensions_and_outlines">Package dimensions and outlines</a>
for details on the various &ldquo;size&rdquo; specifications of a package.
</p>
<p>
If a package does not have pins (termination is either &ldquo;endcap&rdquo; or
&ldquo;no-lead&rdquo;, the lead-to-lead size does not need to be filled in (it is
by consequence identical to the body size).
</p>
</div>

<h2>References</h2>
<div class="midsection">
<p>
If a package is standardized by one or more normative institutions, the name of
the standard and the name of the institution can be added here. These fields are
informational; if your company uses internal standards, these can be added here
as well.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Related packages</h2>
<div class="midsection">
<p>
If a package is related to a different package, the name of the other package
can be added here. For example, the diode packages SOD123 and SOD123F are identical
except for their pin shape (gull-wing versus lug-lead). It then makes sense to
mark these packages as related to each other.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Variants</h2>
<div class="midsection">
<p>
The middle section in <a href="#Figure_user_interface">the user interface</a>
is for the variants of the generic package. The generic package portrays a
flattened view. For a long time, EDA programs needed no more that this
representation. For assembly of the PCB, and for mechanical design (e.g. design
of the enclosure), the height of the package also becomes an important parameter
(and it is quite common that a generic package exists in different heights).
This is why the details of various variants can be entered in a table. See the
topic <a href="help-concepts.html#Common_names_variants">Common names &amp; variants</a> for
background information.
</p>
<p>
For example, an LQFP package and an TQFP package share all parameters (and they
share it with the generic QFP package), except that LQFP is about 1.5&thinsp;mm thick
and TQFP about 1.0&thinsp;mm.
</p>
<p>
Each variant must have a unique name, and the name of a variant may not conflict
with any of the aliases for the generic package either. Names for variants may
follow a standard or an ad-hoc convention &mdash;see also topic
<a href="help-standards.html#Package_naming_standards">Package naming standards</a>.
If it is a standardized convention, you can indicate that convention on the row too.
Doing so enables applications to translate between naming conventions.
</p>
<p>
For the &ldquo;flat view&rdquo; dimensions, <span class="smallcaps">Packages</span>
stores the <em>nominal</em> size and a tolerance from that nominal size. For the height,
it uses a range: minimum height to maximum height. The motivation is that package
standards also specify the height as a range; IPC-7351 only records a <em>maximum</em>
height in its naming convention.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Footprint</h2>
<div class="midsection">
<p>
The bottom section of <a href="#Figure_user_interface">Figure 1</a>
has design parameters for the footprint. A single package may have multiple
footprints. For example, the IPC-7351 standard defines footprints for <em>Least</em>,
<em>Nominal</em> and <em>Most</em> spacing between components (less spacing allows
for higher density). Some packages may also define an adjusted footprint for
wave soldering (as opposed to reflow).
</p>
<p>
The majority of footprints use a single pad shape & size for most (or all) of
the pins. <span class="smallcaps">Packages</span> splits the pad shapes from the
pad positions for a package. Thus, you often need to add only one or two pad
shapes, even for packages with a high pin count.
</p>
<p>
In the pad shape specification, you can furthermore mark a pad as &ldquo;exposed
pad&rdquo; (also called a thermal pad). A pad marked as such is then only valid
for those variants that are also marked as having an exposed pad (in the
&ldquo;variants&rdquo; section of <a href="#Figure_user_interface">the user interface</a>).
</p>
<p>
For example, for a HSOIC8 package (8-pin SOIC with 1.27&thinsp;mm pitch and an exposed-pad):
</p>
<ul>
<li> a variant for the package must be added, with an appropriate name (for
     example, SOIC8P127_495X600X175T330X240 according to IPC-7351, or
     HSOIC8-3.8x4.95 according to ED-7303);
<li> in the column &ldquo;exposed-pad&rdquo;, a tick mark should be placed on
     the row for the variant;
<li> in the footprint section, a pad shape must be added with the size of the
     exposed-pad, and this pad must also have a tick mark in the column
     &ldquo;exposed-pad&rdquo; (this will have pad-id 2 for this example package);
<li> a pad with pin-id 9 (one more than the pin count of the package, so 9 for
     an SOIC8) must be added, and referencing pad-id 2.
</ul>
<p>
The exposed pad is typically <em>not</em> included in the pin count (in the package
characteristics, top section of <a href="#Figure_user_interface">the user interface</a>).
